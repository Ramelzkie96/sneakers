## Overview
Sneakers is a modern and stylish static e-commerce landing page designed to showcase and promote Nike Air Max sneakers. Built with clean HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles, this site delivers a visually engaging user experience across all devices. The project highlights:

- A preloader animation for a polished entry experience.
- A sticky header with intuitive navigation for easy browsing.

- A product sale section featuring multiple sneakers with promotional tags and consistent styling.

- Interactive buttons and hover effects to enhance engagement.

- Responsive design, making the layout adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

This site is ideal for practice in frontend development, static site deployment, and e-commerce layout design using only HTML and CSS.
